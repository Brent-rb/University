1_2_GET.output vs 1_2_HEAD.output

A HEAD request only return the headers. They are exactly the same as the ones 
made in the GET request with the exception of the Transfer-Encoding header.
This one is only present in the GET request. This header indicates that 
the body of the request will be transferred in chunks. Since the HEAD request
reply has no body it does not add this header. 

1_2_IMAGE
The content-type is "image/gif". The data starts with "GIF" as well.
After removing the headers from the output, the image is distorted. 

1_2_GOOGLE
Accept-Language: de

Tested with host: google.de, redirected to www.google.de.

Got a german translation

1_2_HTML vs 1_2_RDF
GET /resource/Berlin
Accept: application/rdf+xml 

This request resulted in a content negotiation, I got a couple of candidates from which I could choose, "/data/Berlin.xml" had content type "application/rdf+xml" 
so I made a different request 

GET /data/Berlin.xml
Accept: application/rdf+xml 

output can be found in 1_2_RDF.output

-----------------------------------------------------------

GET /resource/Berlin
Accept: text/html 

This request redirected me to /page/Berlin

GET /page/Berlin
Accept: text/html

output can be found in 1_2_HTML.output

------------------------------------------------------------

Comparing the outputs of both requests, the content type header differs
and the RDF version has an extra header.

The different outputs also differ in representation.
The HTML one is in HTML and the RDF/XML one is in XML.
